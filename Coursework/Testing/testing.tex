\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing}

I used decided to use a wide range of testing strategies to look out the different aspects of the program. For example to test the GUI in series 1 top-down testing was performed to check the if all the interfaces and the flow between them was working correctly. Bottom-up testing was used in series 2 to test the validation were functioning correctly, it was also used in series 4 to check the data can be read through the tables from the database file. Black-box testing was used in series 3 to make sure that the data was in fact being stored in the database and that emails were sent and stored in inboxes. Black-box testing was also used in series 7 to check shortcuts were working correctly. Unit testing was used in series 5 to test the different main programs for Staff, Managers and Admins on different access levels. Acceptance testing was used for series 6 to make sure the whole system worked correctly and met the specifications I compared this test with my original objectives.

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

The testing allowed me to see problems in my system. For example in test 6 the system actually didn't meet the full specifications that the client wanted. The amount of time I had was just enough to produce the GUI for the system I did not have the time or skill needed to produce an online version so multiple staff can access it at once. However I can add this functionality to my system at a later date. Also when editing and removing data the system removed the text foreign keys are reverts to numbers to reference primary keys, obviously this is a very unfriendly way to delete and edit data ( \ref{fig:RemoveDataButtons}).

\par Another issue was in test 8.4. The problem here was with the automated email. It does not work in the way that is ideal since it will not automatically work out dates while the program is running, instead it can only work out the days left if the program is restarted once a day. However most likely the program would be reset each day in a real company, but it is still a big problem that would need to be fixed at a later date.

\subsection{Strengths of Testing}

The strengths of my testing came from the wide range of testing I did. Mainlythis was from the GUI with top-down testing in series 1. I covered my whole system and uncovered any problems shown above. In series 3 I also managed to perform a lot of validation tests covering the entire system which made sure any user can use the system without running into any errors.

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}

My weakness was mostly around test series 8 when testing algorithms. There were a lot more than just this amount of algoritms in the system and it may have been useful to identiify them.

\subsection{Reliability of Application}

Reliability when relating to my system is used to explain if it is consistently performing according to its specifications. I believe that testing has shown that my system is largly reliable as it thoroughly tests my whole system and outlines where the problems are, however there are only a few of problems in the entire system (that have been found - 6 and 8.4) which proves its reliability. The main problem that effects reliability that can be fixed is the fact that foreign keys arent user friendly when removing or editing data.

\subsection{Robustness of Application}

Robustness is used when explaining if the software can cope with any errors during execution. The testing has proved that my program handles errors very well. At no point was an error shown in the console and all calculations were made correctly. Any errors were shown with a GUI error message to allow the user of the system understand what they have done wrong.
