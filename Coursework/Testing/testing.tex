        \textbf{Test Series} & \textbf{Purpose of Test Series} & \textbf{Testing Strategy} & \textbf{Strategy Rationale}\\ \hline
1 & Test flow of control between the user interfaces & Top-down testing & A outline of the GUI will be developed and once working more modules will be added \\ \hline
       2 & To test validation of input data is performed correctly & Bottom-up testing & Components will be tested as they become available \\ \hline
3 & To test if the data is stored in its correct location & Black box testing & An output that the program produces will be examined for correctness and then the next output can be examined.\\ \hline
4 & To check information can be read from the database and read through the system & Bottom-up testing &  Components will be tested as they become available\\ \hline
5 & Check that the system cannot have unauthorised access & Unit testing & To test individual software components \\ \hline
6 & To check the finished system will fulfil the specifications &  Acceptance Testing & Performed by the client to check the system meets their requirements\\ \hline
7 & To test that the UI works effectively and certain shortcuts can be pressed & Black Box Testing & An output that the program produces will be examined for correctness and then the next output can be examined.\\ \hline
8 & Test algorithms to make sure that the output is correct & White Box Testing & Tests will be derived from knowledge of the program code \\ \hline
